# About me 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm a blockchain developer who also builds production-ready backend systems to handle Web3 transaction flows, integrate smart contracts, and ensure DB consistency. I don‚Äôt just write contracts ‚Äî I build the whole system around them.‚Äù

IMPORTANT:
Blockchain Side apply graph and sub graph for data indexing which is going onto the blockchain

````
Add infura web socket free tier edition to handle transaction time from etherscan

1. Controller mai validation check kia then Queue mai pass kr dia jo Queue mai function create kia tha 
2.

# PENDING
````
1 After server crashed update the ongoing transaction and check redis to not to repeat the same transaction avoid double spending
